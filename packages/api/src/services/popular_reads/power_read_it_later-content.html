        At the end of 2014 I received an email informing me that I had read over
        a million words in the ‘read it later’ app Pocket over the course of the
        year.

        What makes this number significant (in my view) is that it represents 22
        books’-worth of long-form reading that would not have happened without a
        system in place.

        We’ve made a habit of filling those hundred random spaces in our day
        with glances at Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. But those glances have
        slowly become stares, and those stares have grown to encompass a major
        portion of our waking hours.

        I’m not talking about basic literacy. What has become exceedingly scarce
        (and therefore, valuable) is the physical, emotional, attentional, and

        sustained periods of time.

      <h3>Read It.&nbsp;Later.</h3>
      <p>
        Before I explain the massive, under-appreciated benefits these apps
        provide, and how to use them most effectively, a quick primer in case
        you’re unfamiliar.
      </p>
      <p>
        So-called “Read It Later” apps give you the ability to “save” content on
        the web for later consumption. They are essentially advanced bookmarking
        apps, pulling in the content from a page to be read or viewed in a
        cleaner, simpler visual layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of that core function they add features like favoriting, tags,
        search, cross-platform syncing, recommended content, offline viewing,
        and archiving. The most popular options are:
      </p>

        The app I use, Pocket, adds a button to the Chrome toolbar that looks
        like this:

        Clicking the button while viewing a webpage turns the button pink, and
        saves the page to your “list.” Navigating to getpocket.com, or opening
        the Pocket app on your computer or mobile device shows you a list of
        everything you’ve saved:

          You can also view your list in a “tile” layout on the web, making it
          into essentially a personalized magazine. Personalized, in this case,
          not by a cold, unfeeling algorithm, but by your past self:

        Marking an item as read in one version of the app will quickly sync
        across all platforms. It will also save your current progress on one
        device, so you can continue where you left off on a different device
        (for those longer pieces).

        The highest leverage point in a system is in the intake — the initial
        assumptions and paradigms that inform its development

        >
        about how to use Evernote as a general reference filing system, not only
        to stay organized but to inspire creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I didn’t address a key question when creating any workflow: how and
        from where does information enter the system? The quality of a
        workflow’s outputs is fundamentally limited by the quality of its
        inputs. Garbage in, garbage out.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are A LOT of ways we could talk about to improve the quality of
        the information you consume. But I want to focus now on the two that
        Read It Later apps can help with:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Increasing consumption of long-form content (which is presumably more
          substantive)
        </li>
        <li>Better filtering</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>#1 | Increasing Consumption of Long-Form Content</h3>
      <p>
        In order to consume good ideas, first you have to consume many ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the fundamental flaw in the “information diet” advice from Tim
        Ferriss and others: strong filters work best on a larger initial flow.
        Using your friends as your primary filter for new ideas ensures you
        remain the dumbest person in the room, and contribute nothing to the
        conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that our entire digital world is geared toward snackable
        chunks of low-grade information — photos, tweets, statuses, snaps,
        feeds, cards, etc. To fight the tide you have to redesign your
        environment — you have to create affordances.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Affordance (n.): a relation between an object and an organism that,
          through a collection of stimuli,
          <strong
            >affords the opportunity for that organism to perform an
            action.</strong
          >
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Let’s look at the 4 main barriers to consuming long-form content, and
        the affordances that Read It Later apps use to overcome them:
      </p>
      <h4>1. App performance</h4>
      <p>
        We know that the most infinitesimal delays in the loading time of a
        webpage will dramatically impact how many people stay on the page.
        <a
          href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Google found</a
        >
        that increasing the number of results per page from 10 to 30 took only
        half a second longer, but
        <strong>caused 20% of people to drop off</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think your behavior is not affected by such trivialities, think
        again. Even on a subconscious level, you will resist even opening apps
        that don’t reward you with snappy response times. Which is a problem
        because the apps most people turn to for reading are either ebook apps
        like iBooks and Kindle, or web browsers like Chrome and Safari. I’m not
        sure which category is slower, but they’re both abysmal.
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, your snaps and instas refresh at precog-like speeds.</p>
      <p>
        Read It Later apps, by slurping in content (articles, videos,
        slideshows) into a clean interface, eliminate the culprits — ads, site
        analytics, popups — all the stuff you don’t care about.

        Much of the time when we pull out our phone, we’re looking for something
        to match our mood (or energy, or time available, or other context). We
        use our constellation of shiny apps as mood regulators and
        self-soothers, as time-fillers and boredom-suppressors, for better or
        worse.

        So you need a little entertainment, and you open…an ebook? Yeah right.
        Monochrome pages don’t attract you. They don’t draw you in.

        Pocket gives reading some of this stimulatory pleasure by laying out
        your list in a pleasing, magazine-style layout (at left). Not only is it
        generally attractive, but it gives you that same magazine-flipping
        pleasure of engaging with something that interests you
        <em>right in that moment</em>.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “It’s practical to have organized reading material at hand when you’re
          on your way to a meeting that may be starting late, a seminar that may
          have a window of time when nothing is going on, a dentist appointment
          that may keep you waiting, or, of course, if you’re going to have some
          time on a train or plane. Those are all great opportunities to browse
          and work through that kind of reading. People who don’t have their
          Read/Review material organized can waste a lot of time, since

      <h4>3. Asynchronous reading</h4>
      <p>
        This is one of the least understood barriers to reading in our
        fragmented timescape.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is something deeply, deeply unsatisfying about repeatedly starting
        something and not finishing it. This is what we experience all day at
        work, being continuously interrupted by a stream of “emergencies.” The
        last thing we want after a stressful day starved of wins is to fail even
        at reading an article.

        of Dr. Roy Baumeister, who has shown that “uncompleted tasks take up
        room in the mind, which then limits clarity and focus.” The risk of
        cognitive dissonance at not being able to finish a long article (much
        less a book) keep us from even beginning it.

        Read It Later apps address this by simply saving your progress in a
        given article, allowing you to pick back up at a different time, or on a
        different device, and clearly marking items as “read” once you’re
        finished.

      <h4>4. Focus</h4>
      <p>
        A common response when I recommend people adopt
        <em>yet another</em> category of apps is “Why don’t I just use
        Evernote?” Or whatever app they’re using for general reference or task
        management. Evernote even makes a Chrome extension called
        <a

        for reading online content and

        >
        for saving it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a question of focus. Why don’t you use your task manager to keep
        track of content (i.e. “Read this article”)? Because the last thing you
        want to see when you cuddle up with your hot cocoa for some light
        reading is the hundreds of tasks you’re not doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, the last thing you want to see when you (finally!) have time
        to read is the thousands of notes you’ve collected from every corner of
        the universe, only some of which you haven’t read, only some of which
        you <em>want</em> to read, only some of which are <em>meant</em> to be
        read.

      <h3>#2 | Better filtering</h3>
      <p>Now you’ve got the funnel filled. It’s time to narrow it.</p>
      <p>
        Most advice on this topic focuses on being more selective about your
        sources. Cutting out the email digests that just throw you off track,
        unfollowing people posting crap, or even

        The problem is that this assumes you are always at your best, always at
        100% self-discipline, totally aligned with your life values, priorities
        ship shape.
      </p>
      <p>Yeah.</p>
      <p>
        In the moment, with your blood sugar at a negative value and every fiber
        of your being screaming for a dopamine hit, <em>of course</em> that
        Buzzfeed article seems like the best conceivable use of your time. If
        you think you can permanently seal off your life from the celebrity
        news, content marketing, and spammy friends that dominate the web, the
        NSA has a job for you.

      <p>
        Procrastination is the most powerful force in the universe.
        <em>It will find a way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a different approach: <strong>waiting periods</strong>. Every
        time I come across something I may want to read/watch, I’m totally
        allowed to. No limits! The only requirement is I have to save it to
        Pocket, and then choose to consume it at a later time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve found that even just clicking a link to open the URL, in order to
        save it to Pocket, is too much of a temptation. The first glimpse of a
        cute GIF and I’m off to Reddit, completely forgetting my morning email
        session.
      </p>
      <p>
        So instead I just <strong>command-click</strong> every link I’m
        interested in (or
        <strong>right-click &gt; Open link in new tab</strong>), which opens
        each link in a separate tab <em>without taking me to that tab</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s what a typical Monday morning link-fest looks like, just from
        email:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/0x0,s6KkWg-OdGcQNuvOShcztrmaslDz3Cm5o9rD1eDOxxRc/https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*cLy09F0SPJJmi0WfazXi3Q.png?w=900&ssl=1"
          data-src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*cLy09F0SPJJmi0WfazXi3Q.png?w=900&ssl=1"
          data-recalc-dims="1"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, because I’m still in <strong>collection mode</strong>, not in read
        mode, I cycle through each tab one at a time (<strong
          >shift-command-}</strong
        >
        or <strong>control-tab</strong>), saving each one to Pocket using the
        shortcut I set up: <strong>command-p</strong> (chosen for irony and to
        avoid inadvertent printing).
      </p>
      <p>There’s only one rule: <strong>NO READING OR WATCHING!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Bringing this back to filtering, not only am I saving time and
        preserving focus by batch processing both the collection and the
        consumption of new content, I’m
        <strong>time-shifting the curation process</strong> to a time better
        suited for reading, and (most critically) removed from the temptations,
        stresses, and biopsychosocial hooks that first lured me in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always amazed by what happens: no matter how stringent I was in the
        original collecting, no matter how certain I was that this thing was
        worthwhile, I
        <strong>regularly eliminate 1/3 of my list before reading</strong>. The
        post that looked SO INTERESTING when compared to that one task I’d been
        procrastinating on, in retrospect isn’t even something I care about.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I’m essentially doing is creating a buffer. Instead of pushing a
        new piece of info through from intake to processing to consumption
        without any scrutiny, I’m creating a pool of options drawn from a longer
        time period, which allows me to make decisions from a higher
        perspective, where those decisions are much better aligned with what
        truly matters to me.
      </p>

      <p>Here’s a visual of how this works, from my Pocket analytics:</p>

          data-recalc-dims="1"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see that I save more things toward the beginning of the week and
        the weekend, and then draw down the buffer more towards the end of the
        week.

        Imagine for a second if we could do this with everything. On Saturday
        morning, well-rested and wise, you retroactively decide everything you
        <em>want to have done</em> during the previous week. Anything you decide
        was not worthwhile, you <em>get that time back</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I experienced this recently with email — after returning from a 10-day
        meditation course during which I was completely off the grid, I was
        surprised to notice it took only 1.9 hours to process almost 2 weeks’
        worth of email (I track these things). I normally spend on average 2.19
        hours on email <strong>per week</strong> —<em
          > what happened to those extra 2.48 hours?!</em
        >
        Besides the gains from batch processing such a large quantity of emails
        at once, I believe the main factor was that I evaluated my emails from a
        longer time horizon and higher perspective, more correctly judging
        whether something was worth responding to or acting on.

      <h3>Mo’ apps, mo’&nbsp;problems</h3>
      <p>
        There are drawbacks, which I’ve glossed over until now. The two main
        ones:
      </p>
      <h4>1. Formatting issues</h4>
      <p>
        Many sites, including popular ones, aren’t presented correctly within
        the Pocket app (and I imagine others). There’s always the option of
        opening the link in a web browser, but this eliminates all the positive
        affordances and then some. If there wasn’t so much value provided
        otherwise, this would be a deal breaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        The worst part is that, sometimes, the article is cut off or links don’t
        appear <em>without any indication that something is amiss</em>. On Tim
        Ferriss’ blog, for example, links (of which there are many) are simply
        removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        One solution is to tag problematic items with “desktop” so you know that
        these need to be read/viewed on your computer.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Dependence</h4>
      <p>
        Every productivity tool eventually becomes a victim of its own success.
        In this case, I’ve become so dependent on Pocket that bugs really affect
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the Share to Evernote feature, which I use to highlight and
        save key passages, has been broken for at least a month. My hysterical
        tweets to Pocket Support have been answered but not resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        You wouldn’t think such a minor feature within one app could be so
        disruptive, but it has been massively so. This simple workflow:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Highlight &gt; Share &gt; Share to Evernote &gt; Save</em>
      </p>
      <p>…has been replaced with this:</p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Highlight &gt; Copy &gt; Switch to Evernote &gt; New note &gt; Paste
          &gt; Switch back to Pocket &gt; Share &gt; More &gt; Copy URL &gt;
          Switch back to Evernote &gt; Paste URL &gt; Switch back to Pocket</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Worse, I often forget to go back and grab the URL, so I have to hunt it
        down at some later date.

          href="http://breakingsmart.com/season-1/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >has written</a
        >, we’re moving from a world of <strong>containers</strong> (companies,
        departments, semesters, packages, silos) to a world of
        <strong>streams</strong> (social networks, info feeds, main streets of
        thriving cities, Twitter). Problems and opportunities alike resist
        having neat little boxes drawn around them. There’s way too much to
        absorb. Way too much to even guess what you don’t know.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the pace of change in the world accelerates, we double down on all
        the methods that created the problems in the first place — more
        planning, more forecasting, more control and risk management. We’re left
        with massive institutions that nobody trusts, that are simultaneously
        brittle and too-big-to-fail, creating precarity at every level of the
        socioeconomic pyramid.
      </p>
      <p>
        What would it look like instead to solve problems (and explore
        opportunities) in a way that gets better the faster we go?
      </p>
      <p>
        I can’t do justice to Rao’s blog series linked above (it’s in 20
        parts — may want to save it for later&nbsp;;), but the first step he
        proposes is “exposing yourself to as many different diverse streams as
        possible.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When you’re immersed in a stream, the faster it goes, the more novel
        perspectives and ideas you’re exposed to. You develop an
        <a
          href="http://rogerlmartin.com/lets-read/the-opposable-mind"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >opposable mind</a
        > — the ability to juggle and play around with different perspectives on
        any issue, instead of seeing it through one lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increasingly, the only metric that will matter in your journey of
        personal growth will be <strong>ROL: Rate-of-Learning</strong>. We’ve
        heard a lot in recent years about the importance of hands-on learning
        and practical experimentation. We get it. Burying your head in a book by
        itself gets you nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the pendulum is swinging too far in that direction. Yes, you can be
        <em>too</em> action-oriented. Ideas, while cheap when compared to
        effective execution, are still more valuable than many of the other
        things we spend time on.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s another way to learn faster: assimilate and build on the ideas
        of others. Sure, you won’t understand every tacit lesson their
        experience gave them, but you can incorporate many of them, and in a
        fraction of the time it would take you to make every mistake yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideas are high leverage agents. They become more so when arranged in
        highly cross-referenced networks. The only tool we have available that
        is capable of both creating and accessing these networks on demand is
        the human brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lied before. There is one form of leverage even more powerful than the
        initial assumptions and paradigms that inform a system’s development:
        the <strong>ability to transcend paradigms</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          People who cling to paradigms (which means just about all of us) take
          one look at the spacious possibility that everything they think is
          guaranteed to be nonsense and pedal rapidly in the opposite direction.
          Surely there is no power, no control, no understanding, not even a
          reason for being, much less acting, in the notion or experience that
          there is no certainty in any worldview. But, in fact, everyone who has
          managed to entertain that idea, for a moment or for a lifetime, has
          found it to be the basis for radical empowerment.

            achieve your purpose.</strong

        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          It is in this space of mastery over paradigms that people throw off
          addictions, live in constant joy, bring down empires, get locked up or
          burned at the stake or crucified or shot, and
          <strong>have impacts that last for millennia</strong>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage
          points than it does with
          <strong>strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.</strong>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reading is the closest thing we have to thinking another’s thoughts.
        It’s long and sometimes ponderous, but that work is required to wrap
        yourself in another person’s paradigm. Which is the first step in madly
        letting go of your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amazing thing about ideas is that it takes zero time for one to
        change your paradigm. It happens in time, but takes no time, like an
        inter-dimensional wormhole, one entangled particle in your brain
        mirroring its twin across a chasm even more vast than the universe — the
        chasm between two minds.
