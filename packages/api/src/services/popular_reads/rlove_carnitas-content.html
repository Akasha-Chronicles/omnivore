          I used to have a bunch of recipes up online. But writing recipes is no
          fun; it is difficult to capture the beauty of a dish with a bunch of
          steps. Moreover, using recipes isn’t how I cook. I want to understand
          the flavors of a dish and then execute it in my own way, in my own
          hands. So the recipes went away.

          But one of the most popular — and one of my personal favorites — was a
          recipe for the Mexican pork dish <em>carnitas</em>. It was a fun,
          relatively easy recipe, not traditional in approach but fairly
          traditional (and really delicious) in output. Folks keep asking for
          it. So here it is, in hopes I can eat it at your next house party.

          Carnitas is a wonderful Mexican dish, pork shoulder cooked until
          tender and then given a great crisp. In Mexico, carnitas is eaten on
          its own, in tacos, or in tortas. The traditional recipe is simple:
          several pounds of pork shoulder, a pound or two of lard, orange peel,
          and some water (or coca-cola), slow roasted and then “boiled” to a
          crisp. That is…a bit much. What follows is not an authentic approach.

          Never ones to eschew taste for health, the French have nonetheless
          taught us nothing if not that we can make a succulent, flavorful dish
          without boiling a tough cut of meat in lard. In that vein, my recipe
          is more of a <em>braiser de porc</em> than a <em>confit de porc</em> —
          pork shoulder, aromatics, citrus juice, and a little Grand Marnier,
          slow cooked on the stove. Healthier for the heart, but also — more
          importantly — tastier to the tongue. To obtain that classic carnitas
          crisp, we braise the meat uncovered until the liquid evaporates and
          then move the pot to the oven and caramelize.

        <p id="2954" data-selectable-paragraph="">Makes about 6 servings.</p>
        <p id="b0e5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Ingredients:</p>
        <p id="5c56" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          3 lbs <strong>boneless pork shoulder</strong>, preferably Boston butt
          (the upper shoulder)<br />
          4 tablespoons <strong>grape seed oil</strong><br />
          6 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, peeled and thinly-sliced<br />
          2 <strong>oranges</strong>, juiced, plus the zest of 1/2<br />
          2 <strong>limes</strong>, juiced and zested<br />
          several cups <strong>chicken stock</strong><br />
          1 teaspoon <strong>ground cayenne pepper</strong><br />
          1 tablespoon <strong>ground ancho chile</strong><br />
          1 tablespoon <strong>ground chipotle pepper</strong><br />
          2 teaspoons <strong>cumin</strong><br />
          1 teaspoon <strong>ground cinnamon</strong><br />
          1 teaspoon freshly-ground <strong>black pepper</strong><br />
          <strong>herb sachet</strong> with 8 sprigs
          <strong>Mexican oregano</strong>, 6 sprigs <strong>thyme</strong>, 2
          sticks <strong>cinnamon</strong>, and 2 <strong>bay leaves</strong>,
          wrapped in a cheese cloth and tied shut with cooking twine<br />
          1 cup <strong>Grand Marnier</strong><br />
          coarse <strong>sea salt</strong>, to coat meat, plus more to taste
        </p>
        <p id="78f1" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Cut the pork shoulder into 5" chunks. Remove any
          gratuitously-excessive fat, but leave at least a thin layer. Sprinkle
          the chunks with sea salt. Let sit at room temperature at least 30
          minutes. Pat dry.
        </p>
        <p id="c35e" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Heat the grape seed oil in a dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sauté
          the pork shoulder until well browned on each side. If needed, sauté
          across multiple batches.
        </p>
        <p id="5c2a" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Add the garlic and sauté for one more minute.
        </p>
        <p id="48dd" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Add the orange zest, lime zest, ground cayenne pepper, ground ancho
          chile, ground chipotle chile, cumin, ground cinnamon, black pepper,
          and herb sachet. Mix.
        </p>
        <p id="c098" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Add the Grand Marnier, orange juice, and lime juice. Stir, scrapping
          the bottom of the pot.
        </p>
        <p id="88ed" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Add chicken stock as needed such that the pork is two-thirds submerged
          in liquid.
        </p>
        <p id="f490" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Stirring, raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower
          heat until the liquid is at a simmer and braise, uncovered, stirring
          occasionally, until the pork is cooked and tender but not
          disintegrating and the liquid is reduced by at least two-thirds, about
          three hours. If the liquid gets perilously-low while cooking, add a
          little chicken stock.
        </p>
        <p id="efa0" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Remove pork from pot. Once cool enough to handle, use a fork to shred
          the pork into bite-sized, but fairly large, chunks, removing any fatty
          pieces as desired.
        </p>
        <p id="3c34" data-selectable-paragraph="">Preheat oven to 450°F.</p>
        <p id="f864" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Return pork chunks to pot. Place uncovered pot in oven. Continue
          cooking until the liquid has evaporated and the pork is crispy and
          starting to caramelize, about 20 minutes.
        </p>
        <p id="b38a" data-selectable-paragraph="">
          Taste and adjust salt. Serve with warm corn tortillas, guacamole, pico
          de gallo, diced white onion, chopped cilantro, lime wedges,
          margaritas, and college football.
